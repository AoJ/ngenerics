    * New data structures :
        - Single-Valued (i.e) not KeyValuePair version of the RedBlackTree.
        - A generic version of the priority queue that can have a key implementing IComparable, or any object with an IComparer instance. 
		
    * New Patterns :
	- Added the Converted pattern under NGenerics.Patterns.Conversion.
	- Added the Specification pattern under NGenerics.Patterns.Specification.
		
    * New Extension Methods :

	- Missing list extensions in Silverlight
	
    * Changes to existing data structures :
	- Added construction mechanism to Singleton - the Singleton value can now be lazy-instantiated.

	- Moved visitor-related classes to NGenerics.Patterns.Visitor (* breaking change *)
	- Added FindNode method to GeneralTree.
	- The previous version of the priority queue that accepts integers as keys has been renamed to ClassicPriorityQueue. (* breaking change *)
	
    * Bug Fixes :

    * Misc
